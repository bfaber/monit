using googletest:

use ASSERT_* when doens't make sense to continue the test/function
use EXPECT_* when just want to note a failure but continue test/function
eg.
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors x and y are of unequal length";

for (int i = 0; i < x.size(); ++i) {
  EXPECT_EQ(x[i], y[i]) << "Vectors x and y differ at index " << i;
}

<< is a way to send custom error messages to the macro when a test fails
